# Haxor
The code for an App I created called Haxor. 
The App can be found on the app Store at 
This App is a simple puzzle game using a recursive algorithim to generate the playing field.
The goal is to connect the starting 'CPU' icon with the golden 'CPU socket' icon.
You do this via Swiping in one of the 4 cardinal directions. 
You can only move in a straight line and there are obsticles that will block your path. 
Some of the blockers can be destroyed or rotated by taping on them.
You also only have a certain number of moves to connect to the end goal.
The Playing board is dynamically sized based on the difficulty setting
You can also choose between 3 different track to play in the background.
I hope you enjoy it. 
Please feel free to use or learn from any of the code contained within. 
Don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions.
Thanks
